# Custom-Display-using-Waveforms

## Introduction
This project is aimed at having a sample text displayed using waveforms on ModelSim using verilog. 

## Working
The project works on first creating a text file containing only 0's and 1's, where the 1's represent the actual text format. 0's act as space fillers so that the wave sets to 'high' whenever there is a 1 and sets to 'low/zero' when a 0 is present. This is a creative solution to display custom texts using waveforms and not hard coding the entire process.
